        <p>Hi, this is a very quick demo page for CSE 134B. Many thanks to the TA from Fall 2023 for keeping a copy of this source code for me.</p>
        <p>I like taking photos in my free time. The image below was taken way back in 2018 but I lost my phone shortly after and I thought this image was gone forever. But thankfully most of them were backed up on a dead Google Photos account and it took me 7 years to uncover them.</p>
